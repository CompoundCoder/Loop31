Ok now wer need to fix the expo go app not launching the code we are working on in the ios simulator. It just says "New updates avalible, downloading" and the pops up the error in the picture i gave you.

---

_**Assistant**_



---

Okay, I understand the problem. The error message "Could not connect to development server" usually means the Expo Go app on your simulator can't reach the Metro bundler running on your computer.

Let's try a few things to fix this:

1.  **Is the Metro development server running?** Look at your terminal window where you started the app (usually with `npx expo start` or `npm start`). Is it still running and showing logs, or did it crash or get stopped?
2.  **Restart the server with cache clearing:** If it is running, try stopping it (Ctrl+C in the terminal) and restarting it with the `--clear` flag:
    ```bash
    npx expo start --clear
    ```
    Then, try reloading the app in the simulator (you might need to close and reopen Expo Go or press 'r' in the terminal if the option is available).
3.  **Check the Network:** Ensure your computer is connected to the network (Wi-Fi or Ethernet). The simulator should automatically use your computer's network connection.

Let me know if the server was running and if restarting it with `--clear` helps! If not, we can check the IP addresses next.

Same things happens

---

_**Assistant**_



---

Okay, since restarting didn't fix it, let's check the network connection more closely. The error message shows the app is trying to connect to `http://192.168.1.252:8081`.

1.  **Verify your Computer's IP Address:**
    *   On your Mac, go to System Settings > Network > Wi-Fi (or Ethernet). What is the IP address listed there? Does it match `192.168.1.252`?

2.  **Check Expo CLI Network Settings:**
    *   In the terminal where Metro is running (the one you started with `npx expo start --clear`), what IP address does it say it's running on? Usually, it prints something like:
        ```
        Metro waiting on exp://192.168.x.x:8081
        ```
    *   Does the IP address shown in the terminal match the one your computer actually has?

3.  **Try a Different Connection Type:**
    *   When you run `npx expo start`, it usually opens a web interface in your browser (often at `http://localhost:8081` or a similar port). In the bottom left of that web page, there's a "Connection" setting. It might be set to "LAN". Try changing it to "Tunnel" and then reload the Expo Go app on the simulator. Sometimes tunnel connections work better, especially on complex networks.

Let me know what you find for steps 1 and 2, and if trying "Tunnel" makes a difference.

---

_**User**_

IP address for this wifi is 192.168.1.252

---

_**Assistant**_



---

Okay, great, the IP address matches. That rules out one common issue.

Now, could you check these two things?

1.  **Metro Bundler IP:** In the terminal window where you ran `npx expo start --clear`, what IP address does it show? Does it also say `192.168.1.252`?
2.  **Tunnel Connection:** Did you try changing the connection type to "Tunnel" in the Expo Dev Tools web interface (the page that opens in your browser when you start the app)? If not, please try that and reload the app in the simulator.

---

_**User**_

@exp://192.168.1.252:8081 

---

_**Assistant**_



---

Okay, the IP addresses match everywhere. That's good.

Did you get a chance to try changing the connection type to **"Tunnel"** in the Expo Dev Tools web interface (the page that opens in your browser)? If not, please try that now and reload the app in the simulator.

If you *have* tried "Tunnel" and it still doesn't work, we can explore other possibilities like potential firewall issues or resetting the simulator's network settings.

---

_**User**_

I'm not sure how to get to that since it just opens the app inside the sim and not a web browser

---

_**Assistant**_



---

Ah, okay. When you run `npx expo start` (or `npm start`), it should print the URL for the Metro bundler and also the URL for the Expo Dev Tools web interface in the terminal.

Look back at the terminal output right after you started the command. You should see lines similar to this:

```

› Press r │ reload app
› Press m │ toggle menu

› shift+d │ show developer tools... (experimental)

› Press ? │ show all commands

```

Somewhere in that output, often near the beginning or if you press `d` in the terminal, it should give you a URL for the **Developer Tools**, usually something like `http://localhost:19006` or `http://localhost:8081`.

Can you find that URL in your terminal output and open it in your web browser? Once you have that page open, you should see the "Connection" setting in the bottom-left corner. Change it to "Tunnel" and then try reloading the app in the simulator (Press `r` in the terminal where Metro is running, or manually reload in the Expo Go app).

---

_**User**_

The local host thing didnt work either, nothing loaded. Can you scan the files in this app and see if theres any reason it might not be working? 

---

_**Assistant**_



---

Okay, it's strange that even the local dev tools UI isn't loading. This suggests the problem might be deeper than just the network connection between your machine and the simulator. It could be an issue with how the Metro bundler itself is starting or configured within the project.

I'll examine some key configuration files to see if anything stands out.

First, I'll check your `app.json` file for any specific development server or bundler settings.

---

Read file: app.json

---

The `app.json` file looks pretty standard. There are no explicit overrides for the development server host or port. The bundler is set to `metro` for web, which is expected, but doesn't directly impact the iOS simulator connection.

Next, I'll check `package.json` to look at the dependencies (like `expo`, `expo-router`) and the start scripts.

---

Read file: package.json

---

Dependencies look reasonable, using Expo SDK 52 and `expo-router`. The start script is simply `expo start`.

Now, let's look at the Babel configuration.

---

Read file: babel.config.js

---

The `babel.config.js` looks correct. It uses the standard `babel-preset-expo` and includes the `react-native-reanimated/plugin` as required. The `expo-router/babel` plugin is correctly commented out as it's deprecated in recent versions.

Let's check if you have a custom `metro.config.js`.

No `metro.config.js` file exists in the root directory, so we are using the default Metro configuration provided by Expo.

Okay, the main configuration files (`app.json`, `package.json`, `babel.config.js`) look standard and don't show any obvious reasons for the Metro bundler or the connection to fail. The fact that the Dev Tools UI (`http://localhost:19006` or similar) also fails to load is particularly puzzling and might point to:

1.  **Port Conflict:** Is it possible another process on your Mac is already using port `8081` or `19006` (or whichever ports Expo is trying to use)?
2.  **Firewall:** Although less common for `localhost` connections, a strict firewall could potentially interfere.
3.  **Corrupted Expo/Metro Installation:** Sometimes, node modules or global Expo CLI installations can get into a bad state.
4.  **Simulator Issue:** Less likely if the dev tools UI also fails, but we could try resetting the simulator.

Let's try checking for port conflicts first. I'll run a command to see if anything else is listening on port 8081.

---

```bash
lsof -i :8081 | cat
```

```

```

---

Okay, that output confirms that a `node` process (PID 4716) is listening on port 8081 (`sunproxyadmin` is just the service name for port 8081). This is expected, as it should be the Metro bundler you started with `npx expo start`. There doesn't appear to be a *different* process conflicting on that port.

It also shows connections *from* "Expo Go" (PID 2938, likely the simulator app) *to* port 8081 on your machine, but they are `ESTABLISHED`. This is confusing given the error message.

Let's try checking the port for the Expo Dev Tools UI, which is often `19006`.

---

```bash
lsof -i :19006 | cat
```

```
trevorpowers@Trevors-MacBook-Pro-2 Loop31-SteveBuild % 

```

---

That command returned no output, meaning **nothing** is listening on port `19006`. This explains why you couldn't open the Dev Tools UI in your browser.

It seems like the main Metro bundler process (on port 8081) is starting, but the Expo Dev Tools server (usually on 19006) is *not* starting correctly. This could prevent Expo Go from properly connecting or getting updates, even though a process is listening on 8081.

This might be caused by a corrupted installation. Let's try reinstalling dependencies and the Expo CLI:

1.  **Stop Metro:** If it's still running, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.
2.  **Delete `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`**:
    ```bash
    rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
    ```
3.  **Clear Expo/Metro caches:**
    ```bash
    rm -rf .expo
    watchman watch-del-all
    npx expo start --clear
    ```
    (The `npx expo start --clear` command also clears some caches, but the `watchman` command ensures file watching is reset too. You might need to install watchman if you don't have it: `brew install watchman`)
4.  **Reinstall Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
5.  **Try Starting Again:**
    ```bash
    npx expo start
    ```

I'll run the commands to delete `node_modules`, `package-lock.json`, and clear caches. Then you can run `npm install` and try starting again.

---

```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json .expo && watchman watch-del-all
```

```
<es package-lock.json .expo && watchman watch-del-all
{
    "version": "2025.03.10.00",
    "roots": []
}
trevorpowers@Trevors-MacBook-Pro-2 Loop31-SteveBuild %
```

---

Okay, I've removed the old `node_modules`, `package-lock.json`, and `.expo` directory, and cleared the file watcher.

Now, please run the following commands in your terminal in the project directory (`/Users/trevorpowers/Desktop/Loop31-SteveBuild`):

1.  `npm install`
2.  `npx expo start`

After running those, check if:
a) The Expo Dev Tools UI URL (like `http://localhost:19006`) loads in your browser.
b) The app loads correctly in the iOS simulator when you press `i`.

Let me know the results!

_**Assistant**_



---

Ah, okay. It looks like the `npm install` command failed because of an issue with the npm cache directory (`~/.npm/_cacache`). The errors `EEXIST` (file already exists) and `EACCES` (permission denied) during a rename operation within the cache suggest it might be corrupted or have incorrect permissions.

Let's clean the npm cache forcefully and try again.

I'll run the command to clean the cache.

---

```bash
npm cache clean --force
```

```

```

---

Okay, the `npm cache clean --force` command also failed with an `EACCES` (permission denied) error.

The good news is the error message tells us exactly why: **"Your cache folder contains root-owned files"**. This often happens if you've previously run `npm` commands using `sudo`.

The error message also gives us the command to fix the permissions. I will run this command now using `sudo`. You will likely be prompted to enter your password in the terminal UI that pops up.
